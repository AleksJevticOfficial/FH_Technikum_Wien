Show how humans have had an impact on their environment using examples of technology with which you are familiar.

trends of human changes of environment in modern era
- multiple ways environment is affected grows quickly -> pesticides post 2nd world war; nuclear reactors, jet aircraft, biotechnology
- Local environmental issues gone regional or global f.e. DDT -> major pesticide; lead sulphates North/South poles
- complexity,magnitude,frequency might increase example with dam vs small roman dam


Show how humans have had an impact on their environment using examples of technology with which you are familiar.

As time passes, human interferences and changes and in the environment, especially in modern times, have grown rapidly. There are countless examples, which affect the environment such as the use of powerful pesticides post-date the Second World, the construction of nuclear reactors, jet aircraft and their operation, as well as technological advancements of biotechnology. Moreover, observations show increasing global issues that were once a local problem. DDT, a major pesticide which has appeared in multiple spots around the globe, similar to the appearance of lead and sulphates at the North and South poles, travelled far distances from the original places they were produced. These points show a also growing complexity. A comparison between old and new technology, like modern dams and an ancient Roman dam, hint towards an increase in magnitude and frequency of impacts on the environment.
